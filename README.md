Hatena server - by pbsds (hatena forever fork by purpelpower)
======

This is a replacement for the Flipnote Hatena service for the DSi which has ended.
It's written in Python 2.7.18 and requires Twisted.
Future versions could need PIL aswell.
This project uses Hatenatools, which is also written by pbsds. It can be found here: http://pbsds.net/projects/hatenatools

To use it, simply run server.py.
On the DSi, set the proxy settings to point to this server on port 8080, then access Flipnote Studio as usual. A more detailed guide is on the wiki section.

Documentation on the formats Flipnote Studio uses can be found in the wiki section of this git.

how to run?
1. install python 2.7.18
2. install it with the add to path option
3. install twisted with "pip install twisted"
4. cd to the directory
5. run "python server.py"
6. on your dsi make sure you have flipnote studio
7. go to your network setting and make sure the first dns is 104.248.000.110 and the second is 008.008.008.008
8. go to the proxy settings and set the proxy adress to the ip address of the device which is running it and the port has to be 8080
9. if everything is done correctly you should be able to access flipnote hatena

also if you go to all flipnote i already uploaded some however me if you want your flipnote to be deleted
